Ever wanted fishing in Minecraft to be more of an activity rather than a waiting simulator?
Introducing Fishing Aquatica Expanded inspired by my previous small but moderately popular Fishing Aquatica mod!

Fishing Aquatica Expanded aims to add new activities for people to have while fishing allowing for the player to tailor their fishing to their interests. 
Do you want your fishing experience to be the thrill of hunting down rare items through loot crates? It’s here! 
Do you want fishing to be a mix of a relaxing activity and the thrill of the hunt while you fishing unique and exotic 
mobs with unique rewards? It’s here! All these goodies are waiting for someone to fish them up, will it be you?
